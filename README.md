# homework10-Template-Engine---Employee-Summary

![Employee-Summary-Template-Engine](/images/screenshot.png) 

## Description 
This application uses NodeJS in the command line to prompt the user with questions for entering employees on an IT team. There are three employee categories to choose from: Manager, Engineer, and Intern. Name, id, and email are asked for all employee types. However other questions are specific to the type of employee. For instance, a Manager will be asked to enter an office number, while an Engineer will be asked for their GitHub username, and an Intern will be asked for the school they attended. Once the user is finished entering their employees the user can then enter "n" into the keyboard when prompted for another user. Once the user is finished entering all employees the application uses the entered data and compiles it into an html file and exports it into the output folder. The user can then view the result team.html page in their browser.
